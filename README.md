# Task_2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection (using ML Algorithms)

## Problem Statement:

- For the data science assignment on credit card fraud detection, interns will utilize a Kaggle dataset to develop a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
- They will explore the dataset, which includes anonymized credit card transactions, and perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis. Using various machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, interns will build models to predict fraudulent transactions. 
- They will also evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Task_3 - Gender Detection and Age Detection (using CNN)

## Problem Statement:

- For the data science assignment on gender and age detection, interns will work with a Kaggle dataset to develop robust models for predicting gender and age from facial images.
- They will preprocess the dataset by extracting facial features and apply machine learning techniques such as deep learning and computer vision algorithms. Interns will explore convolutional neural networks (CNNs), facial landmark detection, and age regression models. Through model training, validation, and testing, they will strive to achieve accurate gender and age predictions.
- The assignment will provide interns with hands-on experience in image classification and age estimation using real-world data.
